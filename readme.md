Uses https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/

## Running the project

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## Customisations on top of the theme

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling so `BrainNoteContainer.js` is changed with the classNames corresponding to tailwind.

The popups are also styled this way and the behaviour on mobile is changed. There are no popups on the smaller screens.

And double brackets are hidden by passing an option in the [config](https://github.com/aravindballa/notes.aravindballa.com/blob/0d98c1bdc9b82ee83a6e5af546f0d93afe0f435d/gatsby-config.js#L9).
