title: Workout

Workouts are necessary, not to be in shape, but to function correctly. <span class="highlight">We are designed to move</span>. Not for sitting in front of a screen all day. So workouts are a replacement for that. When we move, the blood supply ðŸ©¸ in the body increases. It flows to the brain too. We become more active that way.

I like working out in the [[morning]]. It doesn't feel draining for me actually. Instead, it's a great start to the day with a sense of accomplishment. The energy rush you have after the workout feels good. In order to repair itself, body gets energized and you start feeling good too.
