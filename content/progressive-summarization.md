<NoteTag color="green">Evergreen</NoteTag>

The notes need to discoverable and understandable.
Layers of compression

1. Notes you take
   “saving” a piece of information is just the beginning of capture
2. **Bold** the best parts
3. <span class="highlight">Highlights</span> across the bold ones
4. Write a mini-summary
5. Remix (Which ideally means you write a blog post or make metaphorical illustrations)
   When you glance, you should get the idea of the note.
