The problems with these handwritten notes is that
these aren't searchable. And we cannot share parts Â­of the note(like copying text) easily. But it is quick
and (sometimes) beautiful.

The [[technology]] is improving though. In apps like
Notability they can be searched. It will index all
your handwriting, which is great. Again, this is
limited to [[iPad]]. This tech is not available across
platforms.

And with these notes, you cannot add hyperlinks
and reference external stuff easily.

I mainly use handwritten notes for noting down
things while coding - to draw flowcharts or
make a quick list of things to do. It is really
handy for that. I had a lot of notebooks for
this in the past. But now, iPad is the replacement
for all of them. (And its searchable too!)
