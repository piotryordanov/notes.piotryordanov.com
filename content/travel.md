Whenever I think of travel, I feel, I should be travelling more. I love exploring new places and cities. If you ask me whether I am a mountain person or a beach person, <span class="highlight">I am both</span>.

I love to [[Trek]] with my buddies, and at the same time, I like visiting [[Beach]]es like Goa.

I remember the last time when I went on a solo trip to [[Goa]] for attending [[React India]] [[conference]]. I went there early so that I could spend some time exploring places. I stayed at Old quarter hostel in Panjim and the experience was amazing. Panjim is beautiful place and it has still got some Portugal vibe to it. The conference was amazing too.
