title: Quality of your Social media is based on people you follow

It is your feed that makes you enjoy a particular social media. And that, is obviously shaped by, the people you follow.
It makes us live in a bubble. We don't see anything other than what's been shown to us by the algorithm, but that's a good thing too.
So unfollow people who aren't a fit you are looking for.
I've been doing this a lot lately on [[Twitter]]. When I started using it, I followed every celebrity I knew. And now, the only ones I care on Twitter are developers and interesting people. So whenever I see a post/tweet from a person I don't want, I unfollow. Now my feed looks curated.
