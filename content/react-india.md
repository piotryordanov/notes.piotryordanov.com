The costliest conference I've ever attended. It was worth it, though.

It was great to meet people I admire, like Jason and Ives, and also made a lot of new friends who share a similar vibe.

The beach made it even more exciting. After the conference, we would get together at a beach shack and enjoy some food and drinks, with a lot of conversations.
