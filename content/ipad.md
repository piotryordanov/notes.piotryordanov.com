This has a strange place in my life. I never knew I would use it until I bought one.

_What do you use it for?_

- Netflix and YouTube
- Drawing
- Taking a lot of notes, mostly [[hand written notes]]
- Editing videos and images.

[[Brittik]] and I have recorded an episode on how we use iPads for [[Learning Curve]] podcast. [Link](https://learningcurve.dev/14)
