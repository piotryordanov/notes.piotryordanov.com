When you open your garage door, meaning, you let people watch you work, you build that trust and transparency with others. Even if the code is not public, you can let people watch your streams
Twitter accounts should not just be announcements, the should also tell about the progress.

Few examples

- [[LevelsIO]] build hoodmaps by live streaming. He also built nomadlist in the open, by crowdsourcing data.
